Activity 11: Prevent the Default

Aim: Create a form that calculates the tip amount based on the bill total and the desired tip percentage.

//Add 2 input elements as children of the form in the html documents, one for the bill total, and one for the tip percentage

//Create a variable for the bill total, tip percentage, returned tip amount, returned total, and submit button using ".querySelector" in the JS file

//Add an event listener for the submit button using ".addEventListener('click', function(event)"

//Add "event.preventDefault();" to prevent the form from clearing after the submit button is clicked, as is the default

//Parse the bill total and tip percentage values to integers using "parseInt()" so that they are no longer strings and we can perform mathematical functions with them

//Create a variable for tip amount and set it equal to the bill total * tip percentage/100

//Create a variable for the new total and set it equal to the bill total + tip amount

//Return the tip amount by setting the text content of the returned tip amount to the tip total using "tipReturn.textContent = tipAmount"

//Return the new total by setting the text content of the returned total to the new total using "totalReturn.textContent = newTotal"
