# Killer Quiz

## Summary

This site houses a 5-question multiple choice quiz about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS basics. The timer for the quiz is displayed in the navbar and the initial time limit is 75 seconds, the timer being reduced by 10 seconds every time a question is answered incorrectly. The site is dynamic, the web application displaying the next question as each is answered as well as whether of not the user got that question right. Once the timer runs out or every question has been answered, the quiz is over and the user is prompted to enter in their initials and submit their score. The scores are stored in a highscore table which saves the top 5 scores and can be accessed at any time using a link in the navbar. They also have the option to clear their score table or go back to the start and attempt the quiz again.

This site is responsive to ensure that the site renders well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
